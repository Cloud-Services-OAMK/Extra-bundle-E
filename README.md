# Markdown page

**This page was created using Markdown language**

It is pretty simple, all you have to do is:

* create a markdown file
* fill it with content (optionally also format it)
* upload it to your GitHub repo
* host it using GitHub pages :octocat:

GitHub will automatically convert your Markdown file into an HTML document. You can of course add multiple pages as well and create [links](/Dall-E) to them. All in all you can create more coplex pages using Markdown but this should be enough to give you an idea of how it works. It should also be enough for this Task.
